            <h3>Hottest day ever, part deux // 06.28.2021</h3>
            <p>
                The high was 109 - now they say 104. Hoping for that bit of meteorological mercy. Thinking of ice water. Ice fishing. The arctic circle. A cold rain. A grey Seattle winter. Popsicles. A Coleman cooler packed with ice and soda and bags of fruit at the end of a little league game. A swimming pool. A tall glass of lemonade. Overzealous air conditioning of a Midwest convenience store. A bright red Icee. Snowmen. A frozen lake. Polar vortex. An ice skating rink. A cold dark movie theater. The walk-in cooler at my first job.

            <h3>Hottest Seattle day ever // 06.27.2021</h3>
            <p>
                104. We broke the all time record. By Monday we will have doubled the amount of days over 100 in recorded Seattle history. Thinking of ice water. Ice fishing. The arctic circle. A cold rain. A grey Seattle winter. Popsicles. A Coleman cooler packed with ice and soda and bags of fruit at the end of a little league game. A swimming pool. A tall glass of lemonade. Overzealous air conditioning of a Midwest convenience store. A bright red Icee. Snowmen. A frozen lake. Polar vortex. An ice skating rink. A cold dark movie theater. The walk-in cooler at my first job.
